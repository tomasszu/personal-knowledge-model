<h3> Excerpt from the abstract of my work: </h3>

<p>
“A model of personal knowledge” <br>
In M. Polanyi’s concept, personal knowledge is not considered objective, on the contrary,
it depends on personal experience and subjective assessment. This paper will examine the
possibilities of creating a model of personal knowledge. The model would enable the
accumulation and actions of personal knowledge. Special emphasis will be placed on the active
transformation of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. Possible recording forms of the
model will be evaluated. It will be written as: an object-oriented program written in Java with
instances of person-specific objects, an ontology described in OWL and visualized in the
OWLGrEd tool, and a neo4j graph database structure. M. Polanyi’s insights in the book
"Personal Knowledge" will serve as a starting point for determining the limitations of this
model's knowledge structure and the functions associated with them.
